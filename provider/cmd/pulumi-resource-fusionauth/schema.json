Anything which is not a user but might need\npermissions managed by FusionAuth is a possible entity. Examples might include devices, cars, computers, customers,\ncompanies, etc.\n\nFusionAuth’s Entity Management has the following major concepts:\n\n* Entity Types categorize Entities. An Entity Type could be `Device`, `API` or `Company`.\n* Permissions are defined on an Entity Type. These are arbitrary strings which can fit the business domain. A Permission\n  could be `read`, `write`, or `file-lawsuit`.\n* Entities are instances of a single type. An Entity could be a `nest device`, an `Email API` or `Raviga`.\n* Entities can have Grants. Grants are relationships between a target Entity and one of two other types: a recipient\n  Entity or a User. Grants can have zero or more Permissions associated with them.\n\nYou can use the Client Credentials grant to see if an Entity has permission to access another Entity.\n\n[Entity API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/entity-management/entities)\n\n",

This Map stores the tokens from the various identity providers so that you can use them in your application to call their APIs.\n\n[Apple Identity Providers API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/apple/#create-the-apple-identity-provider)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n\u003c!--Start PulumiCodeChooser --\u003e\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as fusionauth from \"pulumi-fusionauth\";\n\nconst apple = new fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpApple(\"apple\", {\n    applicationConfigurations: [{\n        applicationId: \"1c212e59-0d0e-6b1a-ad48-f4f92793be32\",\n        createRegistration: true,\n        enabled: true,\n    }],\n    buttonText: \"Sign in with Apple\",\n    debug: false,\n    enabled: true,\n    keyId: \"2f81529c-4d39-4ce2-982e-cf5fbb1325f6\",\n    scope: \"email name\",\n    servicesId: \"com.piedpiper.webapp\",\n    teamId: \"R4NQ1P4UEB\",\n});\n```\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport theogravity_pulumi_fusionauth as fusionauth\n\napple = fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpApple(\"apple\",\n    application_configurations=[{\n        \"application_id\": \"1c212e59-0d0e-6b1a-ad48-f4f92793be32\",\n        \"create_registration\": True,\n        \"enabled\": True,\n    }],\n    button_text=\"Sign in with Apple\",\n    debug=False,\n    enabled=True,\n    key_id=\"2f81529c-4d39-4ce2-982e-cf5fbb1325f6\",\n    scope=\"email name\",\n    services_id=\"com.piedpiper.webapp\",\n    team_id=\"R4NQ1P4UEB\")\n```\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Pulumi;\nusing Fusionauth = theogravity.Fusionauth;\n\nreturn await Deployment.RunAsync(() =\u003e \n{\n    var apple = new Fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpApple(\"apple\", new()\n    {\n        ApplicationConfigurations = new[]\n        {\n            new Fusionauth.Inputs.FusionAuthIdpAppleApplicationConfigurationArgs\n            {\n                ApplicationId = \"1c212e59-0d0e-6b1a-ad48-f4f92793be32\",\n                CreateRegistration = true,\n                Enabled = true,\n            },\n        },\n        ButtonText = \"Sign in with Apple\",\n        Debug = false,\n        Enabled = true,\n        KeyId = \"2f81529c-4d39-4ce2-982e-cf5fbb1325f6\",\n        Scope = \"email name\",\n        ServicesId = \"com.piedpiper.webapp\",\n        TeamId = \"R4NQ1P4UEB\",\n    });\n\n});\n```\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi\"\n\t\"github.com/theogravity/pulumi-fusionauth/sdk/go/fusionauth\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tpulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {\n\t\t_, err := fusionauth.NewFusionAuthIdpApple(ctx, \"apple\", \u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpAppleArgs{\n\t\t\tApplicationConfigurations: fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpAppleApplicationConfigurationArray{\n\t\t\t\t\u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpAppleApplicationConfigurationArgs{\n\t\t\t\t\tApplicationId:      pulumi.String(\"1c212e59-0d0e-6b1a-ad48-f4f92793be32\"),\n\t\t\t\t\tCreateRegistration: pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t\tEnabled:            pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tButtonText: pulumi.String(\"Sign in with Apple\"),\n\t\t\tDebug:      pulumi.Bool(false),\n\t\t\tEnabled:    pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\tKeyId:      pulumi.String(\"2f81529c-4d39-4ce2-982e-cf5fbb1325f6\"),\n\t\t\tScope:      pulumi.String(\"email name\"),\n\t\t\tServicesId: pulumi.String(\"com.piedpiper.webapp\"),\n\t\t\tTeamId:     pulumi.String(\"R4NQ1P4UEB\"),\n\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n}\n```\n```java\npackage generated_program;\n\nimport com.pulumi.Context;\nimport com.pulumi.Pulumi;\nimport com.pulumi.core.Output;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpApple;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpAppleArgs;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.inputs.FusionAuthIdpAppleApplicationConfigurationArgs;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class App {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Pulumi.run(App::stack);\n    }\n\n    public static void stack(Context ctx) {\n        var apple = new FusionAuthIdpApple(\"apple\", FusionAuthIdpAppleArgs.builder()\n            .applicationConfigurations(FusionAuthIdpAppleApplicationConfigurationArgs.builder()\n                .applicationId(\"1c212e59-0d0e-6b1a-ad48-f4f92793be32\")\n                .createRegistration(true)\n                .enabled(true)\n                .build())\n            .buttonText(\"Sign in with Apple\")\n            .debug(false)\n            .enabled(true)\n            .keyId(\"2f81529c-4d39-4ce2-982e-cf5fbb1325f6\")\n            .scope(\"email name\")\n            .servicesId(\"com.piedpiper.webapp\")\n            .teamId(\"R4NQ1P4UEB\")\n            .build());\n\n    }\n}\n```\n```yaml\nresources:\n  apple:\n    type: fusionauth:FusionAuthIdpApple\n    properties:\n      applicationConfigurations:\n        -

This identity provider defines the claims inside the incoming JWT and how they map to fields in the FusionAuth User object.\n\nIn order for this identity provider to use the JWT, it also needs the public key or HMAC secret that the JWT was signed with. FusionAuth will verify that the JWT is valid and has not expired. Once the JWT has been validated, FusionAuth will reconcile it to ensure that the User exists and is up-to-date.\n\n[External JWT Identity Providers

It will provide a `Login with Facebook` button on FusionAuth’s login page that will leverage the Facebook login pop-up dialog. Additionally, this identity provider will call Facebook’s Graph API to load additional details about the user and store them in FusionAuth.\n\nThe email address returned by the Facebook Graph API will be used to create or lookup the existing user. Additional claims returned by Facebook can be used to reconcile the User to FusionAuth by using a Facebook Reconcile Lambda. Unless you assign a reconcile lambda to this provider, on the `email` address will be used from the available claims returned by Facebook.\n\nWhen the `picture` field is not requested FusionAuth will also call Facebook’s `/me/picture` API to load the user’s profile image and store it as the `imageUrl` in FusionAuth. When the `picture` field is requested, the user’s profile image will be returned by the `/me` API and a second request to the `/me/picture` endpoint will not be required.\n\nFinally, FusionAuth will call Facebook’s `/oauth/access_token` API to exchange the login token for a long-lived Facebook token. This token is stored in the `UserRegistration` object inside the `tokens` Map. This Map stores the tokens from the various identity providers so that you can use them in your application to call their APIs.\n\nPlease note if an `idp_hint` is appended to the OAuth Authorize endpoint, then the interaction behavior will be defaulted to `redirect`, even if popup interaction is explicitly configured.\n\n[Facebook Identity Providers

It will also provide a\n`Login with LinkedIn` button on FusionAuth’s login page that will direct a user to the LinkedIn login page.\nAdditionally, after successful user authentication, this identity provider will call LinkedIn’s `/v2/me` and\n`/v2/emailAddress` APIs to load additional details about the user and store them in FusionAuth.\n\nThe email address returned by the LinkedIn `/v2/emailAddress` API will be used to create or look up the existing user.\nAdditional claims returned by LinkedIn can be used to reconcile the User to FusionAuth by using a LinkedIn Reconcile\nlambda. Unless you assign a reconcile lambda to this provider, only the email address will be used from the available\nclaims returned by LinkedIn.\n\nFusionAuth will also store the LinkedIn `access_token` returned from the login endpoint in the `identityProviderLink`\nobject. This object is accessible using the Link API.\n\nThe `identityProviderLink` object stores the token so that you can use it in your application to call LinkedIn APIs on\nbehalf of the user if desired.\n\n[LinkedIn Identity Providers API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/linkedin)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n\u003c!--Start PulumiCodeChooser --\u003e\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as fusionauth from \"pulumi-fusionauth\";\n\nconst linkedin = new fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn(\"linkedin\", {\n    applicationConfigurations: [{\n        applicationId: fusionauth_application.myapp.id,\n        createRegistration: true,\n        enabled: true,\n    }],\n    buttonText: \"Login with LinkedIn\",\n    debug: false,\n    enabled: true,\n    clientId: \"9876543210\",\n    clientSecret: \"716a572f917640698cdb99e9d7e64115\",\n    scope: \"r_emailaddress r_liteprofile\",\n});\n```\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport theogravity_pulumi_fusionauth as fusionauth\n\nlinkedin = fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn(\"linkedin\",\n    application_configurations=[{\n        \"application_id\": fusionauth_application[\"myapp\"][\"id\"],\n        \"create_registration\": True,\n        \"enabled\": True,\n    }],\n    button_text=\"Login with LinkedIn\",\n    debug=False,\n    enabled=True,\n    client_id=\"9876543210\",\n    client_secret=\"716a572f917640698cdb99e9d7e64115\",\n    scope=\"r_emailaddress r_liteprofile\")\n```\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Pulumi;\nusing Fusionauth = theogravity.Fusionauth;\n\nreturn await Deployment.RunAsync(() =\u003e \n{\n    var linkedin = new Fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn(\"linkedin\", new()\n    {\n        ApplicationConfigurations = new[]\n        {\n            new Fusionauth.Inputs.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInApplicationConfigurationArgs\n            {\n                ApplicationId = fusionauth_application.Myapp.Id,\n                CreateRegistration = true,\n                Enabled = true,\n            },\n        },\n        ButtonText = \"Login with LinkedIn\",\n        Debug = false,\n        Enabled = true,\n        ClientId = \"9876543210\",\n        ClientSecret = \"716a572f917640698cdb99e9d7e64115\",\n        Scope = \"r_emailaddress r_liteprofile\",\n    });\n\n});\n```\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi\"\n\t\"github.com/theogravity/pulumi-fusionauth/sdk/go/fusionauth\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tpulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {\n\t\t_, err := fusionauth.NewFusionAuthIdpLinkedIn(ctx, \"linkedin\", \u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInArgs{\n\t\t\tApplicationConfigurations: fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInApplicationConfigurationArray{\n\t\t\t\t\u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInApplicationConfigurationArgs{\n\t\t\t\t\tApplicationId:      pulumi.Any(fusionauth_application.Myapp.Id),\n\t\t\t\t\tCreateRegistration: pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t\tEnabled:            pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tButtonText:   pulumi.String(\"Login with LinkedIn\"),\n\t\t\tDebug:        pulumi.Bool(false),\n\t\t\tEnabled:      pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\tClientId:     pulumi.String(\"9876543210\"),\n\t\t\tClientSecret: pulumi.String(\"716a572f917640698cdb99e9d7e64115\"),\n\t\t\tScope:        pulumi.String(\"r_emailaddress r_liteprofile\"),\n\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n}\n```\n```java\npackage generated_program;\n\nimport com.pulumi.Context;\nimport com.pulumi.Pulumi;\nimport com.pulumi.core.Output;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInArgs;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.inputs.FusionAuthIdpLinkedInApplicationConfigurationArgs;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class App {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Pulumi.run(App::stack);\n    }\n\n    public static void stack(Context ctx) {\n        var linkedin = new FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn(\"linkedin\", FusionAuthIdpLinkedInArgs.builder()\n            .applicationConfigurations(FusionAuthIdpLinkedInApplicationConfigurationArgs.builder()\n                .applicationId(fusionauth_application.myapp().id())\n                .createRegistration(true)\n                .enabled(true)\n                .build())\n            .buttonText(\"Login with LinkedIn\")\n            .debug(false)\n            .enabled(true)\n            .clientId(\"9876543210\")\n            .clientSecret(\"716a572f917640698cdb99e9d7e64115\")\n            .scope(\"r_emailaddress r_liteprofile\")\n            .build());\n\n    }\n}\n```\n```yaml\nresources:\n  linkedin:\n    type: fusionauth:FusionAuthIdpLinkedIn\n    properties:\n      applicationConfigurations:\n        -

            "description": "## # OpenID Connect Identity Provider Resource\n\nOpenID Connect identity providers connect to external OpenID Connect login systems. This type of login will optionally provide a Login with …​ button on FusionAuth’s login page. This button is customizable by using different properties of the identity provider.\n\nOptionally, this identity provider can define one or more domains it is associated with. This is useful for allowing employees to log in with their corporate credentials. As long as the company has an identity solution that provides OpenID Connect, you can leverage this feature. This is referred to as a Domain Based Identity Provider. If you enable domains for an identity provider, the Login with …​ button will not be displayed. Instead, only the email form field will be displayed initially on the FusionAuth login page. Once the user types in their email address, FusionAuth will determine if the user is logging in locally or if they should be redirected to this identity provider. This is determined by extracting the domain from their email address and comparing it to the domains associated with the identity provider.\n\nFusionAuth will also leverage the /userinfo API that is part of the OpenID Connect specification. The email address returned from the Userinfo response will be used to create or lookup the existing user. Additional claims from the Userinfo response can be used to reconcile the User in FusionAuth by using an OpenID Connect Reconcile Lambda. Unless you assign a reconcile lambda to this provider, on the email address will be used from the available claims returned by the OpenID Connect identity provider.\n\nIf the external OpenID Connect identity provider returns a refresh token, it will be stored in the UserRegistration object inside the tokens Map. This Map stores the tokens from the various identity providers so that you can use them in your application to call their APIs.\n\n[OpenID Connect Identity Providers

This type of login will optionally provide a Login with …​ button on FusionAuth’s login page. This button is customizable by using different properties of the identity provider.\n\nOptionally, this identity provider can define one or more domains it is associated with. This is useful for allowing employees to log in with their corporate credentials. As long as the company has an identity solution that provides SAML v2, you can leverage this feature. This is referred to as a Domain Based Identity Provider. If you enable domains for an identity provider, the Login with …​ button will not be displayed. Instead, only the email form field will be displayed initially on the FusionAuth login page. Once the user types in their email address, FusionAuth will determine if the user is logging in locally or if they should be redirected to this identity provider. This is determined by extracting the domain from their email address and comparing it to the domains associated with the identity provider.\n\nFusionAuth will locate the user’s email address in the SAML assertion which will be used to create or lookup the existing user. Additional claims from the SAML response can be used to reconcile the User to FusionAuth by using a SAML v2 Reconcile Lambda. Unless you assign a reconcile lambda to this provider, on the email address will be used from the available assertions returned by the SAML v2 identity provider.\n\n[SAML v2 Connect Identity Providers

It will also provide a Login with Steam button on FusionAuth’s login page that will direct a user to the Steam login page. The Steam login uses the implicit OAuth grant and will return to the callback URL with token and state in the URL Fragment. This is handled by the FusionAuth /oauth2/implicit javascript function to pass those values to the /oauth2/callback endpoint.\n\nThis identity provider will call Steam’s API to load the Steam user’s personaname and use that as username to lookup or create a user in FusionAuth depending on the linking strategy configured for this identity provider. However, Steam does not allow access to user emails, so neither email linking strategy can be used and user’s will not be able to login or be created.\n\nFusionAuth will also store the Steam token that is returned from the Steam login in the link between the user and the identity provider. This token can be used by an application to make further requests to Steam APIs on behalf of the user.\n\n[Steam Identity Provider APIs](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/steam/ )\n\n## Example Usage\n\n\u003c!--Start PulumiCodeChooser --\u003e\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as fusionauth from \"pulumi-fusionauth\";\n\nconst steam = new fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteam(\"steam\", {\n    applicationConfigurations: [{\n        applicationId: fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.id,\n        createRegistration: true,\n        enabled: true,\n    }],\n    buttonText: \"Login with Steam\",\n    clientId: \"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n    scope: \"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\",\n    webApiKey: \"HG0A97ACKPQ5ZLPU0007BN6674OA25TY\",\n});\n```\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport theogravity_pulumi_fusionauth as fusionauth\n\nsteam = fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteam(\"steam\",\n    application_configurations=[{\n        \"application_id\": fusionauth_application[\"GPS_Insight\"][\"id\"],\n        \"create_registration\": True,\n        \"enabled\": True,\n    }],\n    button_text=\"Login with Steam\",\n    client_id=\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n    scope=\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\",\n    web_api_key=\"HG0A97ACKPQ5ZLPU0007BN6674OA25TY\")\n```\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Pulumi;\nusing Fusionauth = theogravity.Fusionauth;\n\nreturn await Deployment.RunAsync(() =\u003e \n{\n    var steam = new Fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteam(\"steam\", new()\n    {\n        ApplicationConfigurations = new[]\n        {\n            new Fusionauth.Inputs.FusionAuthIdpSteamApplicationConfigurationArgs\n            {\n                ApplicationId = fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.Id,\n                CreateRegistration = true,\n                Enabled = true,\n            },\n        },\n        ButtonText = \"Login with Steam\",\n        ClientId = \"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n        Scope = \"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\",\n        WebApiKey = \"HG0A97ACKPQ5ZLPU0007BN6674OA25TY\",\n    });\n\n});\n```\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi\"\n\t\"github.com/theogravity/pulumi-fusionauth/sdk/go/fusionauth\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tpulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {\n\t\t_, err := fusionauth.NewFusionAuthIdpSteam(ctx, \"steam\", \u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteamArgs{\n\t\t\tApplicationConfigurations: fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteamApplicationConfigurationArray{\n\t\t\t\t\u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteamApplicationConfigurationArgs{\n\t\t\t\t\tApplicationId:      pulumi.Any(fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.Id),\n\t\t\t\t\tCreateRegistration: pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t\tEnabled:            pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tButtonText: pulumi.String(\"Login with Steam\"),\n\t\t\tClientId:   pulumi.String(\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\"),\n\t\t\tScope:      pulumi.String(\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\"),\n\t\t\tWebApiKey:  pulumi.String(\"HG0A97ACKPQ5ZLPU0007BN6674OA25TY\"),\n\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n}\n```\n```java\npackage generated_program;\n\nimport com.pulumi.Context;\nimport com.pulumi.Pulumi;\nimport com.pulumi.core.Output;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteam;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpSteamArgs;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.inputs.FusionAuthIdpSteamApplicationConfigurationArgs;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class App {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Pulumi.run(App::stack);\n    }\n\n    public static void stack(Context ctx) {\n        var steam = new FusionAuthIdpSteam(\"steam\", FusionAuthIdpSteamArgs.builder()\n            .applicationConfigurations(FusionAuthIdpSteamApplicationConfigurationArgs.builder()\n                .applicationId(fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight().id())\n                .createRegistration(true)\n                .enabled(true)\n                .build())\n            .buttonText(\"Login with Steam\")\n            .clientId(\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\")\n            .scope(\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\")\n            .webApiKey(\"HG0A97ACKPQ5ZLPU0007BN6674OA25TY\")\n            .build());\n\n    }\n}\n```\n```yaml\nresources:\n  steam:\n    type: fusionauth:FusionAuthIdpSteam\n    properties:\n      applicationConfigurations:\n        -

This token can be used by an application to make further requests to Xbox APIs on behalf of the user.\n\n[Xbox Identity Provider APIs](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/xbox/)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n\u003c!--Start PulumiCodeChooser --\u003e\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as fusionauth from \"pulumi-fusionauth\";\n\nconst xbox = new fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBox(\"xbox\", {\n    applicationConfigurations: [{\n        applicationId: fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.id,\n        createRegistration: true,\n        enabled: true,\n    }],\n    buttonText: \"Login with Xbox\",\n    clientId: \"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n    clientSecret: \"693s000cbn66k0mxtqzr_c_NfLy3~6_SEA\",\n    scope: \"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\",\n});\n```\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport theogravity_pulumi_fusionauth as fusionauth\n\nxbox = fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBox(\"xbox\",\n    application_configurations=[{\n        \"application_id\": fusionauth_application[\"GPS_Insight\"][\"id\"],\n        \"create_registration\": True,\n        \"enabled\": True,\n    }],\n    button_text=\"Login with Xbox\",\n    client_id=\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n    client_secret=\"693s000cbn66k0mxtqzr_c_NfLy3~6_SEA\",\n    scope=\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\")\n```\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Pulumi;\nusing Fusionauth = theogravity.Fusionauth;\n\nreturn await Deployment.RunAsync(() =\u003e \n{\n    var xbox = new Fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBox(\"xbox\", new()\n    {\n        ApplicationConfigurations = new[]\n        {\n            new Fusionauth.Inputs.FusionAuthIdpXBoxApplicationConfigurationArgs\n            {\n                ApplicationId = fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.Id,\n                CreateRegistration = true,\n                Enabled = true,\n            },\n        },\n        ButtonText = \"Login with Xbox\",\n        ClientId = \"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\",\n        ClientSecret = \"693s000cbn66k0mxtqzr_c_NfLy3~6_SEA\",\n        Scope = \"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\",\n    });\n\n});\n```\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi\"\n\t\"github.com/theogravity/pulumi-fusionauth/sdk/go/fusionauth\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tpulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {\n\t\t_, err := fusionauth.NewFusionAuthIdpXBox(ctx, \"xbox\", \u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBoxArgs{\n\t\t\tApplicationConfigurations: fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBoxApplicationConfigurationArray{\n\t\t\t\t\u0026fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBoxApplicationConfigurationArgs{\n\t\t\t\t\tApplicationId:      pulumi.Any(fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight.Id),\n\t\t\t\t\tCreateRegistration: pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t\tEnabled:            pulumi.Bool(true),\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tButtonText:   pulumi.String(\"Login with Xbox\"),\n\t\t\tClientId:     pulumi.String(\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\"),\n\t\t\tClientSecret: pulumi.String(\"693s000cbn66k0mxtqzr_c_NfLy3~6_SEA\"),\n\t\t\tScope:        pulumi.String(\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\"),\n\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n}\n```\n```java\npackage generated_program;\n\nimport com.pulumi.Context;\nimport com.pulumi.Pulumi;\nimport com.pulumi.core.Output;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBox;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.FusionAuthIdpXBoxArgs;\nimport com.pulumi.fusionauth.inputs.FusionAuthIdpXBoxApplicationConfigurationArgs;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class App {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Pulumi.run(App::stack);\n    }\n\n    public static void stack(Context ctx) {\n        var xbox = new FusionAuthIdpXBox(\"xbox\", FusionAuthIdpXBoxArgs.builder()\n            .applicationConfigurations(FusionAuthIdpXBoxApplicationConfigurationArgs.builder()\n                .applicationId(fusionauth_application.GPS_Insight().id())\n                .createRegistration(true)\n                .enabled(true)\n                .build())\n            .buttonText(\"Login with Xbox\")\n            .clientId(\"0eb1ce3c-2fb1-4ae9-b361-d49fc6e764cc\")\n            .clientSecret(\"693s000cbn66k0mxtqzr_c_NfLy3~6_SEA\")\n            .scope(\"Xboxlive.signin Xboxlive.offline_access\")\n            .build());\n\n    }\n}\n```\n```yaml\nresources:\n  xbox:\n    type: fusionauth:FusionAuthIdpXBox\n    properties:\n      applicationConfigurations:\n        -

A user is unique by email address or username within a tenant.\n\nTenants may be useful to support a multi-tenant application where you wish to use a single instance of FusionAuth but require the ability to have duplicate users across the tenants in your own application. In this scenario a user may exist multiple times with the same email address and different passwords across tenants.\n\nTenants may also be useful in a test or staging environment to allow multiple users to call APIs and create and modify users without possibility of collision.\n\n[Tenants API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/tenants)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n\u003c!--Start
